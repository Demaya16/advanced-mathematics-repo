# ðŸŽ² Coin Toss Simulation Project

This project simulates a random process involving two coins. The goal is to compute the **mean** and **variance** of the number of heads obtained after a random number of flips using simulation methods. The process follows this structure:

1. **Coin 1** is flipped repeatedly until the first head appears. The number of flips, denoted by \( N \), follows a **Geometric distribution** with parameter \( p \), the probability of heads for Coin 1.
2. After obtaining \( N \) flips from Coin 1, we flip **Coin 2** exactly \( N \) times. Each flip has a probability \( q \) of landing heads. The total number of heads in these \( N \) flips is denoted by \( Y \).
3. The process is repeated for different combinations of \( p \) and \( q \), and we compute the experimental **mean** and **variance** of \( Y \).

## ðŸ§  Problem Description

The goal is to simulate the following process:
- **Coin 1** has a probability \( p \) of landing heads. Flip it until the first head appears. Let \( N \) be the number of flips.
- **Coin 2** has a probability \( q \) of landing heads. Flip it exactly \( N \) times and count how many heads you get.
  
### Key Properties:
- \( N \) is geometrically distributed with parameter \( p \).
- The number of heads from \( N \) flips of Coin 2, \( Y \), is the sum of \( N \) independent **Bernoulli trials** with parameter \( q \).

### Objective:
We want to estimate the **mean** \( E[Y] \) and **variance** \( Var(Y) \) for different values of \( p \) and \( q \) by performing 10,000 trials of this experiment.

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

- **Simulation:** For each combination of \( p \) and \( q \) in the range \{0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9\}, perform 10,000 trials:
  - Flip Coin 1 until the first head.
  - Flip Coin 2 for the number of flips \( N \) and count the number of heads.
- **Results:** For each combination, calculate the **mean** and **variance** of the number of heads from the Coin 2 flips.

### Parameters
- \( p \) and \( q \) represent the probability of heads for Coin 1 and Coin 2, respectively.
- The simulation runs for values of \( p \) and \( q \) from 0.1 to 0.9 in increments of 0.1.

### Tables:
The results are presented in two tables:
- **Mean Table**: Shows the average number of heads for each combination of \( p \) and \( q \).
- **Variance Table**: Shows the variance of the number of heads for each combination of \( p \) and \( q \).
