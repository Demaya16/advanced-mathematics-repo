# ðŸ“Š CDF Simulation of the Sum of Exponentials

This project simulates the process of constructing the **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** for a random variable \( Z = Y_1 + Y_2 \), where both \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) are exponentially distributed random variables with a parameter \( \lambda = 1 \). The goal is to estimate the CDF of \( Z \) by simulating 20,000 trials and constructing the relative frequency table for \( F_Z(z) = P(Z \leq z) \) over 100 equally spaced points between 0.0 and 9.9.

## ðŸ”§ Problem Description

- **Objective:** Estimate the CDF of the sum of two independent exponential random variables.
- **Random Variables:**
  - \( Y_1 \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda = 1) \)
  - \( Y_2 \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda = 1) \)
- **Process:** 
  - Sample values for \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) from the exponential distribution.
  - Compute the sum \( Z = Y_1 + Y_2 \).
  - Use the 20,000 trials to compute relative frequencies \( P(Z \leq z) \) for \( z \in \{0.0, 0.1, 0.2, \ldots, 9.9\} \).
- **Output:** A CDF table similar to the format of the standard normal CDF table, where rows and columns represent intervals in \( Z \).

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- **Sampling from an Exponential Distribution:** 
  - The exponential distribution can be simulated using a uniform random variable on \( [0, 1) \) via the transformation:
    \[
    Y = -\ln(1 - U)
    \]
    where \( U \) is uniformly distributed on \( [0, 1) \).
  
- **Simulating the Process:**
  - For each trial, sample two independent values from the exponential distribution.
  - Compute the sum \( Z = Y_1 + Y_2 \).
  - Track how many times \( Z \) is less than or equal to a given value of \( z \), for each of the 100 points in the range from 0.0 to 9.9.

## ðŸ“Š Results: Sum of Exponentials CDF

The results of the simulation are presented in a tabular format. The table provides the relative frequencies of the event \( Z \leq z \) at each step.
